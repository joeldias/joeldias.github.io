# Forecasting Daily Active Users (DAU)

In this project, I built a forecasting system to predict Daily Active Users (DAU) for a mobile app.

## Problem
Understanding and predicting DAU is critical for resource planning, Live Ops scheduling, and revenue forecasting.

## Approach
- Collected daily player activity data from game telemetry.
- Cleaned and transformed the data using Python (Pandas, Presto SQL).
- Built a SARIMAX time series model to account for seasonality and promotions.
- Validated the model on historical data before deployment.

## Impact
- Achieved forecasting accuracy within Â±5% for 30-day horizons.
- Improved campaign planning efficiency by 20%.
- Provided leadership with clearer DAU expectations for key seasonal events.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn)
- Presto SQL
- Tableau
